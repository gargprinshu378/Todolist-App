The idea is to build a simple Todo App.
Suppose you have a list of items in your bucket that you have to complete in a certain priority order. So you can create a list of items with the required details and as soon as the task is done, you can simply mark it done.
As soon as the user hits the URL, the user should see a field where the user can add the todo items.
Only one todo item can be added at a time.
There will be an add button using which user can add the item in the todo list.
The user will have the option to edit, delete & mark any of the todo items.
As soon as the user clicks on the mark done symbol or button, the item will move done in the list with a strikethrough ( The user should be able to identify the marked done item easily - Add proper CSS ).
Make sure to do everything using AJAX ( No page load )
Please use proper OOPS concepts to build this app.
Make sure to follow the proper coding standards.
Your code should be clean & easy to understand.
Make sure to add proper styling to make it presentable.
